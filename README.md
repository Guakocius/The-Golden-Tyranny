# Solarion: The Golden Tyranny

## Overview

Solarion: The Golden Tyranny is a strategy-driven text-based roleplaying game set in a fantasy world where the Sun Elven Empire has conquered the continent of Apexia. Under the rule of Sun Emperor Lotharian, the empire ushers in a Golden Century of peace and prosperity, but at a cost—oppression, slavery, and the subjugation of the continent's diverse races.

As the empire flourishes, rebellions begin to rise. The oppressed races—humans, dwarves, orcs, and others—are fighting back to restore their independence and topple the elven monarchy. Players will take on the role of either a Sun Elf noble trying to maintain the empire's dominance, or a rebel leader leading the fight for freedom and justice.

The game combines turn-based strategy, combat, and roleplaying with a heavy emphasis on procedural world generation and dynamic storytelling.
